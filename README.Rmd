## How to collaborate

We use the *fork & pull* collaborative development model. This means that you are free to make a parallel copy of this repository, change the source code as you see fit, and then *push* the changes to your personal copy of this repository. All this without requiring any authorization. If the changes you've made to your personal copy of this repository are interesting and you're willing to share them with us, then just have them pulled -- *pull request* -- to this repository. After reviewing the changes, we will decide whether they can be merged -- *merge* -- with the source code of this repository.
